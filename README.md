# "Sire" Botnet for BitBurner
Yes, unfortunately the repo is (mostlyTM)empty for now. The "source code" has hardly been written(to publish-ready degree), and needs to be cleaned up. See test/beta branches(coming soonTM) for more on that. I had to figure out a better way to write and file manage than in-game, as the constant testing of fatal scripts, deletions, etc was causing some serious save file corruption issues. The idea behind it was always to get it out to the world, if for nothing more than proof-of-concepts to myself, so I decided to go ahead and set up shop :D
<br/> <br/>
My ADHD is a nightmare and is exhausting :D
Because of that, this particular "one" (me) could not simply "learn JavaScript". I had to challenge myself. This botnet is being written under a few different constraints.
<br/>

## Build Constraints:
- The entire project is really designed to help me teach myself JavaScript, and that is still it's core function as of now. While I might love some help with things, the basic idea is: "If I can't understand the logic behind it, then it stays in beta/test until I can." If you have a knack for teaching olds dogs new tricks, please free to email me at SireNet@tuta.io. (This email can also be found on my GitHub profile.) <br>

- BitBurner has a way of teaching via locking stuff out from you. It's a neat concept, and I'm definitely someone who gets ahead of myself. I wanted to challenge myself to learn as much as I could pack into just that starting 8Gb of RAM. This is the absolute ceiling for the build, however I do intend to release new versions that break this in order to provide more for the end-youser. <br/>

- When learning a new skill, it is often not the intelligence of the student, nor the subject matter itself that makes steep learning curves difficult. It is the relevance of the material to the student. I am not only teaching myself, but being ADHD means that creating these points of relevance has shifted the initial learning project from one of conceptual proofs, into a living breathing machine. A story has evolved from the code, very losely based on the TV show, "The Strain". I wanted to provide something more to BitBurner, my own little flavor if you will. Nameing variables with cute names as easy reminders has become an absolutely full on story-driven build. This marks the 3rd and final challenge. In the end, the botnet files here will be short and sweet. Story files will be passed to the user after certain challenges met, just like the game. I want the versions of Sire to be less like "Sire Version 1.0" and more like "Sire Season 1"<br/>
